            <p>Hi there, I am Jasmin and I'm glad you ended up on my web page! Today I want to share with you a hobby of
                mine - making
                beaded accessories. Unfortunately, I can not pass you all the necessary materials through the screen, so
                I
                have created
                a virtual interface, where you can create beaded earrings and then try them on. Just don't forget to
                allow
                the camera on
                your device. Have fun with it!
            </p>

                Start by choosing a color by clicking on the button with the desired color. If you want to change the
                size,
                use the "w"
                key to increase and "s" to decrease the size of the bead, or simply use the "Larger" and "Smaller"
                buttons.
                To the right
                of the color palette is a sample of your chosen color and bead size. To add a new bead, press the
                "ENTER"
                key or the
                "Add New Bead!" button on the screen. Note that each bead can be dragged simply by pressing and dragging
                it.
                Once you're
                done with creating the earring, click on the "Try It On!" button to see how the earring YOU have created
                would look on
                your beautiful face! If you want to start over, you can use the "Restart" button on the screen, or you
                can
                press the "r"
                key.
                Okay, now that you know the rules, press the “Start!” button.
