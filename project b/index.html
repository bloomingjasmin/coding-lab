    <div class="div-footer">
        <p>Making beaded jewellery is a creative and meditating process. I like to do it in my leisure time to distress
            and relax
            and I enjoy to wear the result of my work or give it to my friends. Therefore I created an interactive way
            of making a
            beaded earrings online just to have fun with it. To imitate the real process I also made it meditatefull and
            creative,by
            allowing the user to choose the color and size of each bead and arrange the shape of it. In order to get the
            same
            satisfaction as after making accessories with your own hands and wearing it, I created a virtual dressing
            room, where a
            user can look how the earring they made would look on their face.</p>
