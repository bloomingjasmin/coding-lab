        <p> For this project 10, I first made a quick drawing on a piece of paper of a 12-petal-flower with a round
            face in the center. To illustrate it on a p5.js canvas, I have decided to draw a petal using its
            components- a triangle and a semi-circle attached to one side. I did it because I already knew the codes
            for a triangle and a circle.
            To place all 12 petals across the center I had to compute the central angle of each petal â€“ 30 degrees.
            When my sketch was ready, I moved to the p5.js editor. Firstly, I translate the origin to the center of
            the canvas since it makes it easier to code a flower with rotational symmetry. I also created a push and
            pop for petals and face to keep the codes separate since I wanted to animate petals and face
            differently.
            So my number one task was to reillustrate one petal on a canvas. I asked professor Moon to help me
            calculate the coordinates of the vertex of a triangle that was a part of one petal. After I finished
            coding one petal, he also helped me implement the rotation of petals across the center of the flower by
            using frameCount as a time factor.
            Then I worked on the face of the creature. I drew two ellipses for the eyes and slightly rotated them to
            create a more kind look. For the mouth, I wanted to make it smiling and widely open. I had to learn how
            to code an arc since I could not achieve the desired look with a semi-circle. After the face contour was
            done I used randomness to fill the color of the mouth and eyes, making my creature even more funny and
            excited.
            In contrast, I wanted to make a sad look too. So I used a condition mouseIsPressed to switch from a
            happy to a sad face.</p>
